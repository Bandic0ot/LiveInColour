      	It is more focused on the technical aspect of my programming skills than it is on my photography
      	skills. All that being said enjoy some photos I took from all over the world.

				<h1> About Me </h1>
				<p> Born and raised in Saskatoon, SK, my whole life I grew up playing
				 		video-games. I was always curious as a kid asking "How does this work?"
						or "How can I make this better?". This curiosity, something I carry with myself
						to this day, is what drives me. It's what set me down the path of becoming
						a software developer. <br><br> I work hard and I like to have fun and make
						friends along the way. I strive to improve myself in every way and will
						strive to help you make the best product possible. <br><br> I look forward
						to working with you! </p>
